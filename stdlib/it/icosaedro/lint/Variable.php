/**
 * Variable: global, local to function or method, or formal argument.
 * Class properties and instance properties belong to another class.
 * A variable may not exist at all, existing but being not assigned, and exist
 * and being assigned. The following example illustrates these 3 cases:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * # Here, $v still does not exist.
 * if( ... ){
 *	$v = 123; # Here, $v exists and it is assigned
 * }
 * echo $v;  # Here, $v exists but it is not assigned (error)
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * Variables come to life and exist when an assignment is made, or the variable
 * is the formal argument of function, or when the variable returns as actual
 * argument of function that returns by reference.
 * The type of the expression assigned or the type of the formal argument is
 * the type of the variable, and this type never change for all the lifetime of
 * the variable. Instead, its assignment status may change over time from
 * statement to statement depending on the execution path (see the the Flow
 * class for more about static flow analysis).
