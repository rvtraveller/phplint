/**
 * Reader for Excel files.
 * 
 * Several reader classes are provided to support the following file formats:
 * Excel 97 (.xls), Excel 2003 XML (.xml), Excel 2007 (.xlsx), OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods)
 * and CSV (.csv). Each reader can be used by its own, or the helper functions of
 * this class can be used instead to automatically detect the file format and apply
 * the appropriate reader.
 * 
 * <p>The following sample of code reads an Excel file and displays its content:
<pre>
$workbook = PHPExcelReader::load("data.xlsx");
foreach($workbook-&gt;getAllSheets() as $worksheet){
	echo $worksheet-&gt;getTitle(), ":\n";
	$rows = $worksheet-&gt;getHighestRow();
	$cols = $worksheet-&gt;getHighestColumnNumber();
	for($r = 1; $r &lt;= $rows; $r++){
		for($c = 1; $c &lt;= $cols; $c++){
			$cell = $worksheet-&gt;getCellByColumnAndRow($c, $r);
			$coord = $cell-&gt;getCoordinate();
			$humanReadable = $cell-&gt;getFormattedValue();
			echo "$coord: $humanReadable\n";
		}
	}
}
</pre>
 * 
 * <p>In the example above, cells' values are displayed using the general formatting
 * function, which has several limitations (see the documentation for more).
 * The Cell class also provides methods to detect and retrieve the value of a cell
 * in a format suitable for further manipulation in the program, like strings, numbers,
 * dates and times.
 * 
 * <p>The reader implemented here always read in the whole Excel file in memory
 * to made it available to the application program as a data structure of sheets
 * and cell. This in not very efficient when very large quantities of data are involved.
 * Consider instead to use simple CSV files in these cases.
 * 
 * <p>This implementation is based on the PHPExcel 1.8 library
 * available at {@link https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel} but tailored for use
 * with PHPLint and its standard library. A list of the main differences follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only data read is implemented. You cannot create Excel files with this library.</li>
 * <li>Formulas are not evaluated.</li>
 * <li>All the strings entering and exiting from this library are assumed UTF-8 encoded.</li>
 * <li>Data formats are parsed allowing to retrieve a more precise description of
 * the values, differentiating between time, date and time, currency and other types.
 * See the methods of the {@link \com\github\phpoffice\phpexcelreader\Cell Cell}
 * class for more.
 * </li>
 * <li>File formats that require XML parsing now uses the PHP's DOM extension
 * in place of the old simplexml extension.</li>
 * <li>The CSV reader properly parses UTF encoded text files, with or without BOM.</li>
 * <li>This package can be validated with PHPLint and integrates with its library of
 * tools, including class autoloading and error mapping into exceptions.</li>
 * </ul>
