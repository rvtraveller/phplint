<h2>Global variables</h2>

<p>
The <b>global variables</b> are those variables defined at the global
scope of the package. "Defining" a variable simply means assigning it
a value, like in these examples:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><pre>
$n = 123;
$src = fopen("data.txt", "r");
$matrix[1][$n] = $n + 1;
$redColor = "red";
$colors = array($redColor, "green", "blue");
$adminName = "admin";
$userName = /*. (string) .*/ NULL;
</pre></div>

<p>
In the last line you can see another example of the PHPLint meta-code:
since according to the <i>PHPLint types model</i>, a string can be either a
sequence of characters or the <code>NULL</code> value, and since the
<code>NULL</code> alone isn't a well defined type, a <i>formal
type-cast</i> to the <b>string</b> type is required in order to specify
the type of the expression assigned to the variable <code>$userName</code>
(more on this argument in the following chapters).
</p>

<p>
Global variables private to the package should be declared as "private" using
the PHPLint meta-code:
</p>

<div class="code_box"><code>
/*. private .*/ $dbConn = pg_connect("dbname=SiteDB");
</code></div>

<p>
These private variables are reserved by the package and cannot be used
by client packages. PHPLint raises an error if a private variable is used
or re-defined in another package.
</p>

<p>
The private variables are reported into the list of the <b>Private
items</b> by the PHPLint Documentator.  Since the private variables still
occupy space inside the global name-space, the programmer should take
care to limit their usage, possibly choosing an appropriate naming schema
that prevent collisions. A common practice is to prefix their name
with the package name <code>$ThePkg_theVar</code>.
