<h2 id="toc">PHPLint's Standard Library</h2>

<p>
PHPLint comes with its own library of real PHP code named <i>PHPLint
Standard Library</i>. These libraries provide features intended to be
strictly tight to the PHPLint validator. These libraries are available
under the <tt>stdlib/</tt> directory of the PHPLint package.
</p>


<h3>Handling errors -- errors.h</h3>

<p>
	By including this package, the behavior of both PHPLint and PHP radically
	changes. Basically, this package turns all the errors triggered by the
	PHP functions and user's functions into ErrorExceptions, here including
	even the smallest notice which is commonly ignored by PHP programmers.
	This exception is checked, which means your application may capture and
	handle it with try/catch or declare it as thrown, but cannot ignore it.
	Example of functions that may throw this exception are fopen(), unserialize(),
	array_fill(), parse_url() and many others.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, errors raised by the core PHP engine are translated to the unchecked
	exception InternalException. Being unchecked, its handling is not enforced
	by PHPLint and normally applications should not even try to handle it
	because there errors are bugs and the application should terminate immediately.
	Example of these errors are: division by zero; accessing an array with a key
	that does not exits; including a source file with include() or include_once(),
	call_user_func(), and many others.
</p>

<p>
	For more about the errors.php package, please read its documentation.
</p>




<h3>Autoloading classes -- autoload.php</h3>

<p>
This package contains the magic <tt>__autoload($class)</tt> which is invoked
automatically by PHP (and then by PHPLint too) in order to resolve unknown
classes. Using this package you don't need to <tt>require_once</tt> every class
your source require, as this is performed automatically by PHP at runtime.
PHPLint applies this algorithms also to classes that appear in the meta-code,
in DocBlocks and in the <tt>cast()</tt> function.
</p>

<p>
This package should be located in the root directory of all your PHP sources
as the path of the class it constructs is made relative to the
directory where the package <tt>autoload.php</tt> resides:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
const SRC_BASE_DIR = __DIR__;

/*. unchecked .*/ class AutoloadException extends Exception {}

/*. void .*/ function __autoload(/*. string .*/ $name)
{
    /*. pragma 'autoload' './' '/' '.php'; .*/
    $fn = (string) str_replace("\\", "/", $name) . ".php";
    if( ! is_readable($fn) )
        throw new AutoloadException("__autoload($name): file $fn does not exist or not readable");
    require_once $fn;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The <code>SRC_BASE_DIR</code> constant can also be used to load packages that
are not bare classes:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
require_once SRC_BASE_DIR . "/mylib/mypkg.php";
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To improve the safety of yours programs, this package also checks that the
proper php.ini file had been loaded, that is the php.ini file that resides
in the root directory.
</p>



<h3>The typecast magic function -- cast.php</h3>

<p>
The <tt>cast.php</tt> package provides the <tt>cast()</tt> magic function as
described in the chapter <b>Typecasting</b>. It also defines the
<tt>CastException</tt> unchecked exception derived from <tt>Exception</tt>.
</p>




<h3>Include all -- all.php</h3>

<p>
The <tt>all.php</tt> package simply loads all the packages above,
so providing full support for class autoloading, safe error handling and
safe typecasting in your programs.
</p>
