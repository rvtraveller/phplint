Version 3.x_xxxxxxxx:
====================
+ Fixed and updated modules: date (Owen Leibman), intl (Owen Leibman).

Version 3.0_20160307:
====================

Abstract. First release of PHPLint with support for PHP 5 (default) and PHP 7.
Generic classes have been added using the "erasure" technique fully implemented
under PHPLint; read the reference manual about class templates for more details
and limitations. The most notable new features of PHP 7 are: anonymous classes,
new exception hierarchy, scalar types in signature, return type-hint and UTF-8
escape sequences.

General language (both PHP 5 and 7):

+ Fix: methods implementing interfaces must be now "call compatible" and not
  strictly equal, so allowing to refine a bit their signature, for example
  returning a specific object rather than mixed.
+ Fix: static analysis missed to detect unassigned variables in some cases when
  'break' was involved in compound blocks and 'switch' branches.
+ Fix: ternary operator is left-associative.
+ Class templates and generic classes (see reference, templates chapter):
  . Classes and interfaces may have formal type parameters:
        class Map/*.<K,V>.*/ { }
  . Formal type parameters may have boundaries:
        class List/*.<E extends Sortable>.*/ { }
  . Actual type parameter can be the class wildcard "?", possibly with bounds:
        List/*.<?>.*/
        List/*.<? extends Sortable>.*/
        List/*.<? parent Sortable>.*/
  . DocBlock parser enhanced to support generic types and class wildcard.
  . Documentator enhanced to report templates and type parameters.
+ Add: statically evaluates the ternary operator.
+ Now checks type and value of the directive in declare(DIRECTIVE=VALUE):
	. The value must be statically determined.
	. ticks: the value must int >= 0.
	. encoding: must be string; always signals warning.
	. strict_types (PHP 7 only): must be int 0 or 1.
+ Declaring the signature of function or method, parameters' types and return
  types can be redundantly declared both in DocBlock and in-line (through meta-code
  or PHP 7 type decl) without complaining anymore, but the two types must match
  exactly.
+ New meta-keyword if_php_ver_5, if_php_ver_7 and end_if_php_ver allows to write
  modules definitions depending from the PHP version. These special symbols are
  handled at scanner level; see the modules/core.php module for examples.
+ Added "numeric" PHP keyword, reserved by PHP for future applications.
+ Private members in modules classes can now be defined and are not reported as
  "unused" anymore, so allowing to define identifiers that, although private to
  the core, cannot be redefined in user space. For example, the Exception::$trace
  property cannot be redefined in any extended class.
+ Since PHP 5.6.0, simple evaluations are allowed in static expressions:
  const statement, default value of formal parameter, case switch, class constant.

General language (PHP 7 only):

+ The default parsing mode is PHP 5 and any PHP 7 specific feature is detected as
  error; to enable the PHP 7 parsing mode use the --php-version 7 option.
+ Parses the declare(strict_types=V) statement, with V either 0 or 1.
+ Anonymous classes.
+ Add class constant visibility attributes. For PHP 5 backward compatibility of
  the sources, DocBlock line-tags @access for constants are still tolerated in
  PHP 7 mode and only a "notice" is raised.
+ Named constant arrays are now allowed, and the array dereferencing operator
  can be applied to string constants (to retrieve a char) and to arrays (to
  retrieve an element):
	
		define("HEX", "0123456789abcdef");
		echo HEX[15]; // --> f
		const STATUS = ["on", "off"];
		echo STATUS[0]; // --> on
		echo STATUS[0][1]; // --> n
		class MyClass {
			public const S = "abc";
			function m(){ echo self::S; }
		}
		echo MyClass::S[1]; // --> b

+ UTF-8 escape sequence "\u{HEX}" in double-quoted strings and here-docs.
+ Scalar type declarations: bool, int, float, string.
+ Return type declarations. This includes the new scalar types above, and the old
  type-hints "array" and class name. As there is no way to declare the structure
  of an array, PHPLint extends the syntax allowing some meta-code to cover this lack,
  array/*.[int]TypeOfTheElements.*/, as was already available for param types.
  Although the types of the parameters and the return type can now be declared,
  DocBlock or PHPLint's meta-code are still preferred because more consistent and
  complete, including object and resource, and the nullable types (string, array,
  resource, object) allow NULL as value.
+ The spaceship operator A <=> B is allowed only between numbers.
  Pretty useless under PHPLint; strings must still be compared with strcmp()
  because <=> inherits the same weakness of the others weak comparison operators
  it is based on; arrays comparison is still forbidden.
+ The null coalesce operator A ?? B requires both A and B be of the same type.
  There are very few uses cases for it under PHPLint; the most common usage
	$name = $_GET['name'] ?? 'guest';
  gives error under PHPLint because the left/right types differ (and this code is
  unsafe anyway).
+ Supports new exceptions hierarchy:

		Throwable
			Error
				TypeError (unchecked)
				ParseError (unchecked)
				AssertionError (unchecked)
				ArithmeticError (unchecked)
					DivisionByZeroError (unchecked)
			Exception
				(legacy PHP 5 exception hierarchy here)

  Most of these new exceptions has been made "unchecked" in the assumption that
  application programs should not attempt to catch them. Only Throwable and Error
  are "checked" because if them were "unchecked" all the derived classes should
  be forced to be unchecked as well. This might change in future depending on how
  these exceptions will be assigned to the core functions.
+ Some modules updated with PHP 7 specific new constants, functions and classes.

New tools of the stdlib:

Simple types wrappers:
+ it\icosaedro\containers\BooleanClass: boolean as an immutable object.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\IntClass: int as an immutable object.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\FloatClass: float as an immutable object.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\ResourceClass: resource as an immutable object.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\StringClass: string as an immutable object.

Generic containers:
+ it\icosaedro\containers\GenericIterator<K,V>.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\GenericArray<E>.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\GenericHashMap<K,V>.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\GenericHashSet<E>.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\GenericSorter<T>: sorter interface.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\Pair<A,B>: holds an ordered pair of objects.

I/O enhancements:
+ it\icosaedro\io\PrematureEndException: trunked stream, expecting more data.
+ it\icosaedro\io\tar\TarWriter: TAR file writer.
+ it\icosaedro\io\tar\TarReader: TAR file reader.

Updates in stdlib:
+ dummy.php: mysql module replaced by mysqli.
+ it\icosaedro\bignumbers\BigFloat: speed optimization of sqrt().
+ it\icosaedro\utils\UTF8: extends supports to the whole range of Unicode codepoints
  up to U+10ffff; fixed bug in sanitize() with very long strings.
+ it\icosaedro\regex\Pattern: new method elem0() returns the result of the last
  match as immutable object, so the pattern can be used again safely; matched
  elements and groups are "Printable" for debugging purposes.
+ it\icosaedro\regex\UPattern: new method elem0() returns the result of the last
  match as immutable object, so the pattern can be used again safely; matched
  elements and groups are "Printable" and "UPrintable" for debugging purposes.
+ it\icosaedro\utils\UString: extends supports to the whole range of Unicode
  codepoints up to U+10ffff; added UTF-16 encoding; fixed bug sanitizing very
  long UTF-8 strings; fixed bug in fromASCII() that used '?' instead of the
  Unicode replacement character.

Updated and fixed modules:
  The 'standard' module has been split into several new modules: array,
  core, crypt, data, file, locale, math, networking and phpinfo;
  The 'standard' module now simply include them all, adding also
  standard_reflection and spl to complete all the features which are
  built-in. Programmers concerned with parsing time may then require
  only the pieces they really need; lazy programmers may still require
  'standard'.
  Several modules have been updated: apache, bcmath, bz2, curl, dom, exif,
  fileinfo, filter, gd, gmp, iconv, intl, json, libxml, mcrypt, mssql, mysqli,
  pcre, pdo, pgsql, phar, posix, session, sockets, spl, standard,
  standard_reflection, streams, sybase, tokenizer, xml, xmlwriter, zip, zlib.

PHPLint programs:
+ php script: now detects its own installation dir. in a way that allows to set
  a symbolic link to this command.
+ phpl(.bat) script: added option --php-version 7, the default is still PHP 5;
  added option --[no-]report-prototypes to report methods' prototypes of the
  parsed classes, which may help writing forward declarations.
+ phplint.tcl: added option PHP 5 or PHP 7; added option to generate class
  prototypes.
+ utils/slim.php: fixed missing line feed after here-doc; fixed validation.

Contributed with error reporting and fixes: Guillaume Déflache (updating of the
standard module).

Version 2.1_20151116:
====================
Abstract. Since this release, any support for the by now ancient PHP 4 has been
dropped to make the source cleaner in preparation to support PHP 7. Two new
classes Reader and Writer have been added to support text file reading and writing
accounting for their proper encoding. Functions with variadic parameter is now
supported. Adds the PHPExcelReader class and some WEB utilities. Several fixes.
Since this release, PHP >= 5.5 or PHP >= 7.0 is required in order to run the
PHPLint program and to use some of its libraries.

PHPLint program changes:
+ Fix: the words "implements" and "extends" where missing building the descriptive
  class prototype used in error messages.
+ Fix: prototype of forward declared constructor and destructor where not properly
  recognized and eventually their actual code was signaled as "already declared".
+ Fix: did not properly account for parent constructor call from the constructor
  of the extended class ("new A()" was accounted as a call to the constructor of A).
+ Fix: static flow analysis failed on the for(E1;E2;E3){} statement when E2 is
  empty or unparseable.
+ Fix: static flow analysis failed reporting unassigned parameter that returns
  by reference when the end of the function or method is unreachable.
+ Fix: did not check for missing actual code of functions, classes and methods
  declared 'forward'.
+ Fix: did not check if the default or inherited constructor had been invoked
  before the specific constructor of the class be defined.
+ Fix: restored support for array-like dereferencing of object $a implementing
  ArrayAccess with $a[$k], with key mixed and returning the return type of the
  specific offsetGet() implement method.
+ Fix: the "php.bat" script did not allowed for white spaces in the php.ini path.
+ PHP 4 support dropped:
  . Option "--php-version 4" removed; PHP 5 is the default and only PHP version
    supported.
  . DocBlock: @abstract, @final and @static line-tags removed.
+ Variadic function parameter "function f(...$a){}" (PHP >= 5.6) is now supported
  in DocBlocks, PHP code and 'forward' declarations. The following samples of
  code illustrates the variadic syntax in 'forward' declaration, DocBlock and
  PHPLint's meta-code respectively:

    /*. forward void function f(string ...$a); .*/

    /**
     * @param string ... $a
     */
    function f(... $a){}

    function g(/*. string .*/ ... $a){}

  Pass by reference of variadic parameters "function f(& ... $a){}" is not supported
  because the assigned status of the variables cannot be statically validated.
  Unpacking of array parameters "f(...[1,2,3])" (which is not necessarily related
  with the variadic functions) is not supported because the number of arguments
  passed cannot be validated at runtime. This latter restriction might become a
  serious limitation when variadic methods have to be implemented or overridden,
  and might be relaxed in future releases.
+ Array value returned by function or method can be dereferenced with [] since
  PHP 5.4.0.
+ Added the /*. pragma 'suspend'; .*/ meta-code statement that can be used in global
  context and as member of concrete or abstract class to temporarily suspend parsing
  of the current file; the parsing of the suspended packages is recovered later,
  at the end of the program. This helps resolving recursive dependencies among
  classes and methods in a single-pass parser (EXPERIMENTAL).
+ Removed error message "class with private constructor should be declared final",
  as there are rare use cases for that.

Standard library changes:
+ Fix: it\icosaedro\utils\UTF8::codepointAtByteIndex() failed to throw exception
  when it had to.
+ Fix: it\icosaedro\utils\TestUnit::dump(): non-finite float numbers had a trailing
  ".0" string appended.
+ Fix: it\icosaedro\utils\UString::toISO88591(): codepoints U+0080-U+009f are not
  valid; now replaces with "?".
+ Fix: org\fpdf\FPDF: characters in Adobe PDF core fonts are now accessible
  through their codepoint, as with any other font.
+ Fix: org\fpdf\FPDF: characters from the core fonts were not properly encoded
  as Unicode.
+ Fix: org\fpdf\FPDF::setUnit() did not updated the state.
+ Fix: org\fpdf\FPDF::setLink() did not applied current units.
+ errors.php adds the logCapturedException() to log an exception.
+ it\icosaedro\containers\Hash: two new methods combine() and getIndex().
+ it\icosaedro\utils\UString::fromXxx() now replaces with U+FFFD (Unicode
  replacement character) invalid binary values (before used "?").
+ org\fpdf\FPDF::setAutoPageBreak() returns current status.
+ org\fpdf\FPDF::image() always sets the final current position to the bottom
  right corner of the image just added.
+ Any support for PHP 4 is now removed from the parser, from the libraries and
  from the reference manual; only PHP 5.3+ is supported.

+ New tools of the stdlib:
  com\github\phpoffice\phpexcelreader\PHPExcelReader (reader for Excel files, ODS and CSV)
  it\icosaedro\io\texts\EncodingASCII (ASCII text encoder/decoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\texts\EncodingGeneric (text encoder/decoder based on mbstring, iconv)
  it\icosaedro\io\texts\EncodingInterface (text encoder/decoder interface)
  it\icosaedro\io\texts\EncodingUTF8 (UTF-8 encoder/decoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\texts\ReaderFilterInterface (text reader interface)
  it\icosaedro\io\texts\ReaderByLines (text reader for line-end detectable enc.)
  it\icosaedro\io\texts\ReaderByWords (text reader for fixed bytes/char ratio)
  it\icosaedro\io\Reader (text reader with encoding support)
  it\icosaedro\io\Writer (text writer with encoding support)
  it\icosaedro\web\StoredFile: support for WEB file upload/download storage.
  it\icosaedro\web\OfflineJob: creating and controlling worker processes.
  org\fpdf\FPDFTools::drawGrid (draws reference grid in PDF page)
  it\icosaedro\utils\Errors: Errors and exception handling routines; currently
  available are functions to retrieve the name of global constant or class constant
  given its name prefix and value.

+ Updates and fixes in modules: curl, dom, imap, gd, gettext, libxml, mbstring, mysql, mysqli,
  openssl, pcntl, pcre, pdo, pgsql, regex (removed), session, simplexml, soap, spl,
  simplexml, standard, standard_reflection, streams, sysvmsg, tidy, tokenizer, variant,
  xsl, zip.

+ utils/slim.php: program that removes comments and spaces from a PHP source,
  with several options.

+ phplint.tcl: Support for PHP 4 dropped. Removed "Is module" check box, that
  might confuse beginners if accidentally set while checking normal packages;
  modules can still be checked from the command line with --is-module.

Contributed with error reporting and fixes: Angelo Raco (updating of the standard
module), Chuck Clayton (bug in the php.bat script), Guillaume Déflache (fix and
updating of the standard and tokenizer modules; docs updating).

Version 2.1_20150305:
====================
+ Fix:
  . Did not parsed <?= at global scope.
  . Did not checked the type of the left-hand side of the .= operator, which
    must be a string.
  . Added missing /= operator.
  . Static access to non-static method C::m() is allowed only in the non-static
    context of the class C or its subclass, so that the current $this value is
    set and appropriate. Previous behavior always allowed the expression also
    from the wrong context.
  . NULL value can be assigned to something of type null. Silly, but just for
    consistency; variables and functions of type null are useless anyway because
    they contain or return just one value: NULL.
  . Formal arguments of type string with default value NULL were rendered
    in the documentation as a double-quoted string "NULL" rather than NULL.
  . DocBlock, in-line tag {@link f(arguments)} and {@link C::m(arguments)}: spelling
    of the function and method names are now performed to enforce case-sentiveness;
    sample arguments are reported in the documentation as expected.
  . Detects "use NonQualifiedNonAbsolute;" statement in non namespaced code,
    which is reported as error by PHP with the message: "the use statement with
    non-compound name 'NonQualifiedNonAbsolute' has no effect". Whatever does it
    means. Also suggests to either add a leading \ or remove the useless statement.

+ Implemented PHP language:
  . Parenthesized subexpression dereferencing (EXPR)->... now allowed (PHP 5.6+).
    This allows to write something like (new MyClass())->m().

+ DocBlocks:
  . Links to interface, abstract class and unchecked exceptions are now rendered
    in italic characters to make evident their specific special nature.
  . Requirements (PHP version, modules, packages) moved to the bottom of the
    generated document; descriptive text of the package now appears just at the
    top of the page, which is the first thing one wishes to look at opening the
    page. The ".php" file name extension now removed from the names of the
    required modules.
  . Now recognizes these HTML elements: <u>, <h1>, ..., <h6>.

+ Documentator: after each method, list all the implemented and overridden
  methods.

+ Updates and fixes in modules: gd, standard, zip.

+ Updates and fixes in standard library:
  errors.php (fix: uncaught exception now terminates execution with exit(1)).
  utf8.php (fix: in some cases, u() ignored arguments past the first).
  it\icosaedro\io\InputStream (add method readFully()).
  it\icosaedro\io\ResourceInputStream (now implements SeekableInputStream).
  it\icosaedro\io\StringInputStream (now implements SeekableInputStream).
  it\icosaedro\utils\UString (fix: toUCS2BE() sometimes returned an empty string).
  it\icosaedro\utils\StringBuffer (adds methods length() and setLength()).
  errors.php (PHP core engine errors are thrown as unchecked InternalException;
      see DocBlock of the package for details).

+ New tools of the stdlib:
  bcmath-for-decimal-replacement.php (replacement for the missing BCMATH module).
  bcmath-for-int-replacement.php (replacement for the missing BCMATH module, int only).
  com\tecnick\barcode\Barcode (barcode generation, several specialized classes).
  com\tecnick\barcode2d\Barcode2D (2D barcode generation, several specialized classes).
  it\icosaedro\io\SeekableInputStream (interface to a seekable input stream).
  org/fpdf/FPDF (PDF document generator).
  it\icosaedro\geometry (2D geometry)

Version 2.0_20141127:
====================
+ Fix: require_module crashed if module loading failed.
+ Fix: did not properly shown the name of an undeclared global variable found
  in `global' statement.
+ Fix: did not properly parsed DocBlock's in-line tag in short description.
+ Fix: PHPLint's Documentator reported NULL literal string in double-quote.
+ Added unimplemented keywords to the Scanner, so appropriate error message can
  be shown: callable, insteadof, trait, yield.
+ The PHPLint program now sends its output to the php://output, rather than
  to php://stdout, so the output undergoes to the same processing of "echo".
+ New tools of the stdlib:
  UnimplementedException (unimplemented functions may throw this)
  it\icosaedro\io\ZipFileReader (ZIP file reader)
  it\icosaedro\io\Base64InputStream (Base64 stream decoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\Base64OutputStream (Base64 stream encoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\DeflateOutputStream (DEFLATE stream compressor)
  it\icosaedro\io\DeflateInputStream (DEFLATE stream decompressor)
  it\icosaedro\io\GZIPInputStream (GZIP stream decoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\GZIPOutputStream (GZIP stream encoder)
  it\icosaedro\io\InputStreamAsResource (Converts InputStream into PHP's resource)
  it\icosaedro\io\KeepTailInputStream (Output stream filter that retains a given amount of trailing bytes.)
  it\icosaedro\io\OutputStreamAsResource (Converts OutputStream into PHP's resource)
  it\icosaedro\io\SkipHeadOutputStream (Output filter that skips initial bytes)
  it\icosaedro\io\SkipTailOutputStream (Output filter that skips final bytes)
  it\icosaedro\io\SplitOutputStream (Output stream filter that split)
  it\icosaedro\io\StreamWrapper (PHP's stream wrapper class)
  it\icosaedro\io\UncloseableOutputStream (Stream filter that prevent close)
  it\icosaedro\io\ZLIBCompressInputStream (ZLIB decompressor)
  it\icosaedro\io\ZLIBCompressOutputStream (ZLIB compressor)

+ New hierarchy of specialized IOException-s:
  it\icosaedro\io\FileException (extends IOException for disk file exceptions)
  it\icosaedro\io\FileNotFoundException (extends FileException)
  it\icosaedro\io\FilePermissionException (extends FileException)
  it\icosaedro\io\CorruptedException (extends IOException)
  it\icosaedro\utils\StringBuffer (more efficient using the php://memory stream)

+ Changes to existing classes:
  it\icosaedro\io\FileInputStream: throws more specialized IOException-s as
  listed above: FileNotFoundException and FilePermissionException.
  it\icosaedro\io\StringOutputStream: removed "abstract" attribute to make it
  directly usable. Uses the new StringBuffer that makes it very efficient.
  
+ Updated modules: bz2, standard, streams, zip.

Version 2.0_20140824:
====================
+ Fix: failed parsing statements beginning with the "namespace" operator.
+ Fix: implemented missing --[no-]parse-phpdoc option.
+ Fix: implemented missing --doc-ref-remap option.
+ Fix: did not properly detected class autoloading failure and crashed.
+ Fix: cast(T,V) crashed at runtime displaying invalid cast when V was
  "array[int]" or was "array[string]".
+ Added "mixed" as type recognized by cast(T,V). This allows to scan unknown
  arrays of any type, for example:
		cast("mixed[]", $any)    (returns mixed[])
		cast("array", $any)      (the same using the old array syntax)
		cast("array[]", $any)    (the same using the old array syntax)
  and so on.
+ Fix: File::getParentFile() failed on Unix.
+ Fix: crashed in Documentator searching global variable.
+ Fix: Documentator did not escaped HTML special chars in literal strings.
+ Fix: Linux shell scripts 'php' and 'phpl' now support spaces in arguments.
+ Fix: phplint.tcl did not updated the dir. of php.ini as the PHPLint package
  changes; now the configuration panel asks for the "PHPLint directory" rather
  than the "php.ini directory".
+ Updated modules: tokenizer.

Version 2.0_20140331:
====================
Completely rewritten program, now in PHP >= 5.3 itself. Please, read the
README.txt file for installation and usage.

+ Abstract class may re-define inherited abstract method (PHP bug #43200).
+ Private [non-]static method may re-define inherited private [non-]static
  method (PHP bug 61761).
+ A class can now implement the same method inherited from different interfaces,
  but the signature must be equal (PHP >= 5.3.9). Under PHPLint, this means the
  2 inherited methods must have the exact same prototype (same return type,
  arguments types, errors and exceptions).
+ Redundant implemented interfaces is detected and forbidden. PHP allows to
  list "... implements BaseInterface, ExtendedInterface" in that order, but
  gives a fatal error if the order is reversed. PHPLint is more conservative
  and forbids any redundancy (in the example, only ExtendedInterface should be
  listed because already includes BaseInterface).
+ Support array short syntax "[E1,E2,E3]".
+ Added the "triggers" meta-code (see example below; also see the @triggers
  DocBlock line-tag below).
+ int can be compared with float, no need to cast int to float.

+ DocBlock:
  . DocBlocks referring to the current file as a whole MUST have the @package
    line tag.
  . Missing @param for formal arguments are not signaled as error anymore.
    The type of the argument is can be guessed from the default value (if
	available) or from the PHPLint meta-code /*.T.*/. Finally, and only if the
	type cannot be determine, an error is reported.
  . Missing @return is not signaled as error anymore. The returned type can be
    read from the PHPLint meta-code (if available) or from the first "return"
	statement, or "void" if not "return" statement is found. Using the value
	returned when still not determined (example: recursive call) is signaled
	as error; in this case, an explicit declaration is required.
  . In-line tags {@xxx} are now resolved immediately, so the same name
    resolution that applies to PHP items holds; in particular, forward
	references to source code that follows cannot be made.
  . Added the "@triggers ERROR DESCR" line tag, where ERROR is any PHP error
    label (E_NOTICE, E_WARNING, etc.).
  . Removed the "@global TYPE $VAR" line-tag. Global variable must be always
    assigned in global scope, and there can be documented as usual.
  . "@var TYPE DESCR" is now "@var TYPE" (removed DESCR part; short and long
    descriptions already do the job).
  . Allows &nbsp; &lt; &gt; $le; and &ge; escape codes.

  . In-line tags:
    . Are now resolved only if the documentation gets generated. This way,
      {@link ITEM} any item, for example the DocBlock of a class may refer
      a method which is declare below. This behavior differs from types in
      line-tags, that are resolved *while* parsing the file and then cannot
      make reference to items that are still undefined at the time that line
      gets parsed. In-line tags have offer more freedom and flexibility, for
      example while documenting a class:
      
      /**
       * My class. So, so, and so. Try the beautiful
       * method {@link self::hello()} that prints hello.
       */
      class MyClass {
          function hello(){ echo "Hello!"; }
      }

    . "self" and "parent" can be used.
    . Absolute file paths /usr/www or C:/User are not allowed anymore; only
      relative file paths starting with ./xxx and ../xxx are.
    . Added https:// protocol to {@link https://xxx}.
    
+ Old style annotations blocks /*. DOC xxxx .*/ support removed and signaled
  as error by the scanner. Use DocBlock or PHPLint meta-code instead.

+ Undefined constants, variables, functions, classes, and class members are
  always signaled as error (previously only the first occurrence was signaled
  and further messages about the same item were avoided, so the programmer
  had to fix an error at a time).

+ Parsing of the signature of function and method:
  . Always tries to guess the return type from the return statement, no more
    log messages if the declaration is missing. Explicit return type must be
    indicated in DocBlock or meta-code only if the function/method is called
    before the parsing of the first "return" be completed, otherwise an error
    is reported.
  . Formal arguments for which a type cannot be determined are signaled and
    their type is set to "unknown" (not mixed as before). So, for example:

          /**
           * @param int $a
           */
          function f($a, $b, $c = 0){...}

    an error is signaled only for $b whose type cannot be determined, while
    $a and $c are obviously int.
    Constructors and destructors methods always return "void".
  . New meta-code keyword "triggers" added to support declaration of triggered
    errors in prototypes, functions and methods and abstract methods. Example:

        interface MyIF {
            function m() /*. triggers E_WARNING throws Exception .*/ ;
        }

        /*. forward function f() triggers E_USER_ERROR; .*/

  . Un-handled errors and un-caught exceptions must always explicitly declared
    in DocBLock and/or meta-code. This example shows both the usages for
    brevity, but you should choose one in your code:

          /**
           * @triggers E_NOTICE  A bit of problems.
           * @triggers E_WARNING Something went wrong.
           * @throws   Exception Something else went wrong.
           */
          function f() /*. triggers E_NOTICE, E_WARNING  throws Exception .*/
          {...}

+ Support for the new ::class virtual constant: ClassName::class, self::class,
  parent::class (PHP 5).

+ The type T in the cast(T,V) magic function is not limited to a literal string
  or named constant, but it may be any static expression of type string.
  Example:  $other2 = cast(self::class, $other);

+ Command line interface:
  . Removed --debug option (reason: unimplemented).
  . Removed --modules-path (reason: require_once always specifies abs. dir.)
  . Removed --packages-path DIRS command line option (reason: packages must be
    included either with require_once and an absolute path, or through the
    autoloader).
  . Added option --[no-]print-column-number, so that entries of the report
    may have form "FILE:LINE:COL: SEVERITY: DESCRIPTION" allowing external
    tools to display the exact point of the error.
  . The diagnostic messages reported may span over several lines (see reference
    manual, chapter "Usage" for details about the format of the report).

+ GUI tool phplint.tct:
  . "phplint.tk" changed name into "phplint.tcl".
  . Now calls the PHP CLI interpreter and then runs PHPLint.php.
  . Can displays file paths relative to the source being parsed (use the
    "relative" option).

+ utils/GenerateDoc.php helps to generate the documentation from a directory of
  source files. See the README.txt file for more details.

+ PHPLint standard library:
  . it\icosaedro\regex\Pattern: fixed bug that causes RuntimeException.
  . New classes of the stdlib:
    it\icosaedro\lint\PHPLint.php (PHPLint program)
    it\icosaedro\io\File (filename abstraction)
    it\icosaedro\io\ResourceInputStream (turns resource into InputStream)
    it\icosaedro\io\ResourceOutputStream (turns resource into OutputStream)
    it\icosaedro\io\LineInputWrapper (read line-by-line from InputStream)
    it\icosaedro\utils\SimpleDiff (determines text file differences)
    it\icosaedro\utils\StringBuffer (dynamic buffer of bytes)
+ PHP modules files modules/*.php:
  . Module files now have their *.php extension, although being not real PHP
    programs (editors with syntax highlight signal syntax errors just
    for this reason, but these errors can be safely ignored because modules
    are never actually executed by the PHP interpreter). Nothing changes
    for the require_module statement, where the name of the module without
    extension must be indicated. So, "standard.php" must be included with
    "/*. require_module 'standard'; .*/" as usual.
  . Updated: json, standard, spl (removed definition of class SimpleXMLIterator
    because relies on the simplexml module which is deprecated by PHPLint),
    zip, zlib.


Version 1.1-201xxxxx:
====================
+ Harald Lapp patch to "compile" script.


Version 1.1-20130803:
====================
+ Updated PHP modules: curl, mysqli, session, spl, standard.

Version 1.1-20120402:
====================
+ FIX: failed to detect positive signed literal constants `const X=+123;' in
  static expressions generating an infinite loop.
+ FIX: in concrete classes, failed to check if all the methods inherited from
  all the interfaces at any deep level were actually implemented.
+ FIX: flow analysis: failed to recognize actual execution path in nested
  do/while loops.
+ FIX: on autoloading, did not properly restored the context of the
  thrown exceptions, possibly forgetting already detected exceptions.
+ Short tag <?= deprecation reverted in PHP>=5.4.0 so it does not generate
  Warning under PHPLint anymore.
+ Updated PHP modules: iconv, pcre, standard.
+ Added modules: fileinfo, intl, phar.
+ Removed modules: mime_magic (replaced by fileinfo).
+ Update PHPLint Standard Libraries:
  it\icosaedro\utils\UString (trimming, case-insensitive comparisons, case
  conversion);
+ Added libraries:
  utf8 (convenience function for UTF-8 encoded source files);
  it\icosaedro\io\InputStream (interface to a generic source of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\OutputStream (interface to a generic drain of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\BufferInputStream (string of bytes as source of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\BufferOutputStream (string of bytes as drain of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\FileInputStream (file as source of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\FileOutputStream (file as drain of bytes);
  it\icosaedro\io\FileName (Unicode file name manipulation);
  it\icosaedro\regex\Pattern (parses strings with regular expressions);
  it\icosaedro\regex\UPattern (parses Unicode strings with regular expressions);
  it\icosaedro\utils\BitSet (set of non-negative numbers);
  it\icosaedro\utils\Histogram (generates an histogram);
  it\icosaedro\utils\UTF8 (handling of UTF-8 encoded strings);
  net\sourceforge\phpmailer\PHPMailer (sends e-mail; GNU LGPL license);
  net\sourceforge\phpmailer\SMTP (supports SMTP protocol; GNU LGPL license);

Version 1.1-20120202:
====================
+ FIX: class autoloading triggered inside function failed to restore the stack
  of the local variables and the list of the thrown exceptions and DocBlock
  parsing.
+ FIX: when errors-to-exceptions mapping enabled, complained missing thrown
  exception declaration in module's functions triggering errors.
+ FIX: bare "array" and "array[]" are now assumed "array[]mixed" as it should
  be, and not "array[]UNKNOWN". This fixes several errors that where signaled
  in assignment and return from function.
+ FIX: arrays of the same type can be added together. Note for non-PHP
  programmers: array("a","b") + array("c") gives array("a","b") and NOT
  array("a","b","c") is you may think so carefully read the PHP manual for
  more details.
+ FIX: statements can now start with the silencer operator "@", so
        @unlink($tmp_file);
  is valid. Restrictions: the silencer operator is not allowed for require*,
  include* and define* statements; the silencer operator cannot be used if
  errors-to-exceptions mapping is enabled, in which case you may use
        try { unlink($tmp_file); } catch(ErrorException $e){...}
+ Supports new syntax "T[]", so that "string[int]" is equivalent to
  "array[int]string" and "float[string][int]" is equivalent to
  "array[string][int]float". This new syntax is supported in any context,
  including PHPLint meta-code, DocBlocks and type descriptor of the cast()
  magic function. This new syntax is preferred under PHPLint over the old form
  "array[]T" because it is shorter and forces to specify the index and the type
  of the elements, avoiding "array[]" or even worse "array". The old form can
  still be useful for PHP type-hinting, where PHP code can be mixed with
  PHPLint meta-code like in this example: function f(array /*. [int]string .*/
  $names){...}.
+ The require_once statement now requires an absolute path, otherwise an error
  is raised. The require, include and include_once now require an absolute
  path, otherwise a warning is raised. Under PHP5, you may use __DIR__ to
  retrieve the directory of the current script.
+ Class name \Exception is now reserved as root of the exceptions tree,
  whickever the module or package it may be declared in.
+ Uppercase/lowercase misspelled keywords, namespaces, contants, functions,
  classes and methods are signaled as errors, not notices. Misspelled
  namespaces and class names prevent class autoloading from working properly on
  case-sensitive file systems (Unix, Linux).
+ Generated documents: also specify which methods any given method implements
  or overrides.
+ Command line options:
    + Add --[no-]fails-on-warning (exit status 1 also on warnings).
    + Add --[no]overall (no final line summarizing total err+warn).
    + Changed behavior of the --[no-]recursive option (see manual for more).
+ On Windows, UNC file names now supported and recognized as absolute paths.
+ Documentator:
  + FIX: exit status did not accounted for errors detected generating docs
    with the --doc option.
  + FIX: in named anchors of the generated URLs, replace \ by / in namespace,
    so internal links become "YourClass.html#na/me/spa/ce::method()"
    (newer releases of FF complained about backslashes).
  + FIX: did not resolved inline tags in "throws" section.
  + DocBlocks:
    + FIX: properly renders line leading spaces (see <pre>) and empty lines.
    + Adds support for array type syntax T[][].
    + Adds non-standard new inline tag {@img URL} to add image.
    + Adds non-standard entities <sup> <sub> <blockquote> <center>.
    + Adds support for Unicode escape sequences &#DDD; and &#xHHH; so arbitrary
      codepoints can be entered.
+ Generated documentation about modules and PHPLint standard library now come
  along the distributed package.
+ phplint.tk:
  + FIX: handles properly white spaces in file names.
  + HTML links to the modules now references the local documents, not the
    www.icosaedro.it WEB site.
+ Updated modules: dom, exif, imap, json, mysqli, pgsql, simplexml, spl,
  standard, streams, zlib.
+ PHPLint Standard Library:
  + cast.php: parsed type descriptors in cast(T,...) are compiled and cached
    for better runtime performances.
  + Adds namespace it\icosaedro\containes (HashSet, HasMap, Arrays).
  + Adds namespace it\icosaedro\sql with support for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
  + Adds several utilities to the it\icosaedro\utils namespace (Bytes, Date,
    Statistics1D, Timer, UString).

Version 1.0-20110223:
====================
+ FIX: magic constants were reported as defined in the first package parsed,
  now are in the 'standard' core module.

Version 1.0-20110206:
====================
ATTENTION! Updated M2 Development System 1.5_20110205 is required in order to
succesfully compile this release of PHPLint from the M2 sources.
+ FIX: crash parsing DocBlock after import of module or library, mostly due
  to a bug in the "buffer" module of M2. The new, fixed, M2 development
  system is now required.
+ FIX: variables are definitely assigned only after the assignment, so that
  things like this one "$x=$x;" gives error if $x isn't already assigned.
+ The magic constants __DIR__, __CLASS__, __FILE__, __FUNCTION__, __LINE__,
  __METHOD__, __NAMESPACE__ are now defined built-in and do not require to
  include the standard module anymore. This is expecially useful for __DIR__
  to build absolute library paths with require_once __DIR_ . "/mypkg.php"
  even before the inclusion of the standard module itself.
+ Add special constants STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR available in PHP CLI that
  cannot be defined in regular PHP code because their type is "resource"
  and not scalar.
+ 'autoload' pragma now allows to specify the directory of the classes as a
  path relative to the autoload.php package, so that a bare '.' usually does
  the right job provided that the autoload.php package be located in the
  root directory of the classes tree.
+ Add modules: sqlite3 (Joan Llosas).
+ Updated modules: curl.

Version 1.0-20101024:
====================
+ FIX: support "static::..." as a statement outside expression (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: cast("SOMECLASS", $obj) with $obj bare object is allowed and,
  at runtime, $obj must be instace of SOMECLASS (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: cast("SOMECLASS", $obj) is allowed if $obj evaluates to null (Jirka
  Grunt).
+ FIX: meta-code keyword "missing_break" must be followed by meta-code
  semicolon, so /*. missing_break ; .*/ is the correct syntax (Petr Kostka).
+ FIX: in the autoload pragma added the 'schema1' parameter according to the
  reference manual. ATTENTION! your custom __autoload() function must now add
  this parameter as well.
+ Fixed and updated modules: dom (Dominic Sayers), spl (Jirka Grunt).

Version 1.0-20100808:
====================
+ FIX: "object" is not a valid type-hint for formal arguments in PHP.
+ FIX: class prototype now supports "implements" (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: add __callStatic() magic method (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: support for the static late binding operator (Jirka Grunt).
+ FIX: the comma before "args" must be inside meta-code, not PHP code.
+ In namespaced classes, warns about methods that have the same name of the
  class and suggests to call them `__construct' (PHP >= 5.3.3 restriction).
+ Add magic function cast() that mostly replaces the formal typecast
  operators. Now under PHP 5 formal typecast /*.(T).*/ allowed only if
  applied to empty array() and NULL in non-static expressions.
+ Add pragma "error_throws_exception" that maps errors into exceptions.
+ Adds the "PHPLint standard library" under the stdlib directory, that
  includes:
  + runtime magic function cast() in cast.php package;
  + error mapping into ErrorException in errors.php package;
  + classes autoloading function in autoload.php package.
+ DocBlock:
  + Leading asterisk in line now no more mandatory and, if present,
    it is simply skipped.
  + Unused @param(s) are reported.
  + Parse the WORD syntactic element also if in the next line.
+ phphlint.tk:
  + "Monitors" the target source, displaying an updated report whenever the
    file changes.
  + Add "Is module" checkbox that allows to parse modules too.
  + Add error color markers bar bar that marks where errors are located.
+ Fixed and updated modules: curl, dom (Dominic Sayers), fdf, filter, ftp, gd,
  json, hash, imap, ldap, mysql, nsapi, pcntl, pcre, pgsql, simplexml, sockets,
  spl (Jirka Grunt, U.S.), sqlite, standard (Jirka Grunt, Dominic Sayers),
  standard_reflection, streams, sysmsg, syssem, sysshm, tidy, xml, xmlreader,
  xmlrpc, xmlwriter, zip, zlib.

Version 0.9-20090802:
====================
Fixed bugs:
+ Namespace resolution: `use' declarations are applied to bare identifiers only
  if are classes; bare identifiers of constants and functions are not resolved
  with `use'.
+ $obj[INDEX] on object implementing ArrayAccess: search offsetGet() method
  also among extended and implemented classes.
+ foreach($obj ...) on object implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate:
  search magic methods also among extended and implemented classes.
+ Check forbidden DocBlock line tags in class constant, property, method.
+ Implementation of concrete and abstract classes declared forward: the forward
  declaration and the actual declaration must have the same attributes private,
  abstract, final and unchecked; moreover, if the forward declaration extends a
  class, then the actual declaration must extend the same exact class too.
+ Attributes of classes must match their forward declaration.
+ The `echo' statement, the `print' statement, the `.=' assignment operator
  and the `.' operator now accept objects that implement __toString().
+ The `print' statement accepts any simple type, not only strings.
+ PHP 4, DocBlock: {@link} can make forward references because these are
  resolved only at the end of the package. Instead, in PHP 5 still reference
  must be resolvable in place because there are the namespace/ operator and the
  `use' declarations to be applied.
+ PHP 4: modules mysql, mysqli and tidy corrected for PHP 4.
+ DocBlocks:
  + In <pre> block, retains leading spaces in lines.
  + Empty lines are properly rendered as paragraph separators.
PHPLint specific features:
+ Checked exceptions MUST be declared either in the `throws' PHPLint meta-code
  or in the `@throws' line tag DocBlock. Actual functions and actual methods
  that implement a prototype must be declare a compatible set of thrown checked
  exceptions.
+ Methods that implements abstract methods or that override inherited methods
  must declare a compatible set of thrown exceptions. Uncought checked
  exceptions in global scope are signaled with a Warning. Uncought checked
  exceptions in function or method must be declared thrown.
+ New meta-code attribute `unchecked' marks exceptions that are unchecked:
  /*. unchecked .*/ class MyException extends Exception {}
  Unchecked exceptions are just like any other exception, but catching them is
  not mandatory. Uncought unchecked exceptions are not signaled anymore.
  Exceptions extending unchecked exceptions must be unchecked.
  Classes `Exception' and `ErrorExceptions' are checked exceptions.
  Exceptions declared in the SPL module are all unchecked.
+ Documentator: for functions and methods, prints a short line that lists all
  the checked exceptions thrown, and a detailed list with all the checked and
  unchecked exceptions for which a description is available.
+ Variables used to catch exceptions as $e in catch(SomeException $e) changes
  their type from a catch() branch to the other, so them are handled in a
  special way: 1. cannot be already in use entering the catch() branch and 2.
  are deleted exiting from the catch() branch so that can be re-used. Flaw: if
  try/catch statements appear in global scope the generated document contains
  some private variables named $catch#1, $catch#2, etc. as an artifact.
+ Updated modules: dom, mysql, mysqli, spl, standard_reflection, tidy.

Version 0.9-20090714:
====================
Fixed bugs:
+ Fixed bug in DocBlock: line tags are now allowed also in DESCR field.
+ Fixed bug in error messages reporting non-ASCII characters (actually a bug
  in the m2runtime.StringToLiteral function corrected in the new release of
  the M2 development system).
PHP syntax:
+ Namespaces (PHP 5.3):
  + Add "namespace" statement.
  + Add "namespace" operator.
  + Add "use" statement.
  + Add "const" statement.
  + Add support for autoloading of classes with __autoload().
  + Support for namespaces in DocBlock.
+ Short tags <? and <?= are now deprecated, use <?php instead.
+ Double-quoted string: added new escape sequences \v \f.
+ Now-doc with double-quoted label and here-doc now supported (PHP 5.3).
+ Parse (but ignores) declare(encoding='xxx').
PHPLint specific features:
+ Packages are now classified as: modules, libraries and programs (see the
  reference manual for details).
+ Class autoloading with __autoload() and the /*.pragma 'autoload'.*/ PHPLint
  meta-code (see the reference manual for details).
+ Detects unsupported BOM leading bytes in source files. ASCII, ISO-8859 and
  UTF-8 without BOM are the only allowed encodings for PHP sources.
+ Detects duplicated labels in `case' branches.
+ Magic constants are resolved into dynamically determinated values: __DIR__,
  __FILE__, __LINE__, __NAMESPACE__, __FUNCTION__, __CLASS__, __METHOD__.
  Expressions whose value can be determinated statically are then allowed also
  in statements as in
      require_once __DIR__."/autoload.php";
  which can be useful for CLI scripts where the CWD is set to the user's CWD.
+ For properties whose type does not allow the NULL value (that is boolean,
  int and float) the initial value must be specified otherwise PHP would
  initialize them to the invalid value NULL. Then, for example:
  private $n = 0;
  private /*. string .*/ $s;
+ For static local variables whose type does not allow the NULL value (that
  is boolean, int and float) the initial value must be specified otherwise PHP
  would initialize them to the invalid value NULL. Then, for example:
  static $count = 0;
  static /*. string .*/ $prefix;
+ Concrete classes that implement Traversable must also implement either
  Iterator or IteratorAggregate, not both (Jirka Grunt).
+ Added new attribute `return' for arguments of function that return a value by
  reference, in addition to the arguments by value and arguments by reference
  that already exists in PHP.
+ $obj[INDEX] for $obj implementing ArrayAccess is allowed, with INDEX of any
  type (the implemented methods should take care to perform any required
  check). The resulting value is the type returned by offsetGet(); since this
  method return mixed in its definition, only string, array, resource and
  objects are allowed as overriding return types. Then bool, int and float
  still have to be returned boxed inside a `mixed'. (Jirka Grunt)
+ foreach($obj as $k => $v): if $obj implements Iterator or IteratorAggregate,
  the type of $k is the return type of the implemented Iterator::key() method
  and the type of $v is the return type of the implemented Iterator::current()
  method; since key() and current() both returns mixed in their definition,
  only string, array, resource and objects are allowed as overriding return
  types. Then bool, int and float still have to be returned boxed inside a
  `mixed'.
+ Flow analysis: handles special cases if(EXPR), while(EXPR), do...while(EXPR)
  whenever EXPR can be statically evaluated to TRUE or FALSE.
+ Definitely assigned variables detection. This feature is under
  development and it is still incomplete: it assumes the variables
  conditionally assigned in expressions as definitely assigned, which is not
  the case as in if(true or ($i = 3) > 0) echo $i; where $i is never assigned.
+ Updated modules: cpdf, dom, gmp, hash, json, ldap, libxml, mysql, mysqli,
  ncurses, oci, openssl, pcntl, pcre, pdo, regex, sockets, spl (Jirka Grunt),
  standard, sysvmsg, tidy, xml, xmlreader.
+ phplint.tk: fixed editor setting.

Version 0.8-20090517:
====================
+ Perform static flow analysis and detect unreachable code and missing return
  statements.
+ In `switch' statement: `case' branches and `default' branch now allowed
  in any order (previously `default' had to be the last).
+ Compound statement {...} now allowed.
+ phpDocumentator DocBlock:
  + Fixed bug in list rendering.
  + Added inline tag {@link}.
  + Added <kbd> speudo-HTML entity.
  + Short description now allows speudo-HTML entities and inline tags.
  + Unimplemented and unknown line tags and inline tags are signaled and then
    rendered verbatim.
+ Added option --[no-]is-module.
+ Updated modules: pdo, spl, standard.

Version 0.8-20090428:
====================
+ Bug fix: in some cases did not correctly built inheritance path of
  extended/implemented methods, causing a program abort.
+ Bug fix: inherited abstract methods cannot be redeclared as abstract
  (PHP restriction).
+ Bug fix: detects circular references in class declarations.
+ Detects redundant class extension and implementation of classes that are
  already in the inheritance tree of the class or interface being declared.
+ Prototypes: `extends' for concrete and abstract classes now supported
  (`implements' still is not) (Jirka Grunt).
+ Prototypes: interface prototypes now supported (but `extends' still
  unimplemented) (Jirka Grunt).
+ DocBlock: @throws line tag added (extension to phpDocumentator commonly
  accepted) (Jirka Grunt).
+ `final' special methods (__construct, __set, __get, ...) now allowed (Jirka
  Grunt).
+ Documentator: fully documents class hierarchy with inheritance tree.
+ Documentator: fully documents descriptions of thrown exceptions (see @throws).
+ Updated modules: curl, ftp, gd, mhash, mysqli, standard (Jirka Grunt),
  spl (Jirka Grunt), standard_reflection, variant.
+ Added modules: xdebug (Jirka Grunt).

Version 0.8-20090102:
====================
+ Class constants now support the visibility flags as meta-code (Jirka Grunt).
+ "... instanceof $str | $obj" now supported (Jirka Grunt).
+ "... instanceof self" and "... instanceof parent" now supported.
+ "new CLASS_NAME();" is now accepted as valid statement.
+ Constructor signature now allowed in interfaces as required by PHP >= 5.2.0
  (Jirka Grunt).
+ Relaxed signature compatibility rule: sub-classes allowed.
+ Missing ?> at the end of the file now allowed (Jirka Grunt).
+ Removed the dummy type `number' because it is not a proper PHP type; use
  `float' instead.
+ Exceptions:
  + Added meta-code 'throws' declaration for functions, methods and protos.
  + Checks exceptions inherited from overridden and implemented methods.
  + Checks branches in try...catch statement.
+ In DocBlock: lines missing the leading `*' are ignored, but following lines
  are handled correctly (fix).
+ Standard module: changed `number' with `float'.
+ Modules mysqli, readline, session, standard: calbacks are now `mixed'
  to support for both functions and methods (Jirka Grunt).
+ Updated modules: standard_reflection, spl.

Version 0.8-20080621:
====================
+ BUG FIX in DocBlock support for interface methods: now parses return type.
+ BUG FIX in standard module: array accessors reset(), next(), etc. use
  argument passed by value, not by reference.

Version 0.8-20080519:
====================
+ Bug fix: now detect single line comments ending with close tag "?>".
+ Bug fix in module standard: "dir" class now is "Directory".
+ Bug fix: DocBlocks are now allowed also in interface classes.
+ PHP bugs fixed:
  Bug #43523: standard module, strrchr(), strstr() and stristr() funcs.
  Bug #45000: standard module, Exception::getTrace() method signature.
+ New: meta-code prototypes allow for forward declared functions, methods
  and classes. See manual ch. "Recursive declarations" for details.

Version 0.7-20071008:
====================
+ The option --modules-path now allows to specify several directories.
+ New option --packages-path that allows to specify the directories of
  the required_once packages.
+ phplint.tk: now supports multiple dirs for the options above.
+ Documentator: added label "include_path", that lists packages found through
  the --packages-path option.

Version 0.7-20070922:
====================
+ Updated modules (PHP 5.2.3): curl, gmp, mysqli, pdo, standard_reflection,
  tidy.
+ phplint.tk: now allows to specify the charset of the generated HTML doc.
+ type hinting `array' was not parsed properly; now it is.

Version 0.7-20070607:
====================
+ Detect collisions among items inherited from extended and
  implemented classes (BUG FIX).
+ Interfaces cannot define a constructor (PHPLint restriction).
+ PHP4: private properties cannot be re-defined in extended class (BUG FIX).
+ PHP5: __clone() must be "public" (BUG FIX).
+ Overriding method cannot make abstract a non-abstract method (BUG FIX).
+ Spaces are forbidden after here-doc label `<<LABEL[SP]' (BUG FIX).
+ Updated modules: standard_reflection.
+ New semantics for option --[no-]print-file-name: if disabled, avoid to print
  the file name of the file whose source is being printed (see --print-source)
  in order to keep the report more readable (BUG FIX).
+ New option --print-path absolute|relative|shortest.
+ phplint.tk: support for option --print-path.
+ phplint.tk: sets proper URL for items imported from extensions (BUG FIX).

Version 0.7-20070529:
====================
+ Added simple GUI phplint.tk (requires the Tcl/Tk interpreter).
+ DocBlocks:
    + Complete support for HTML entities and check for proper usage.
    + Added support for @global.
    + The syntax of the following line tags modified to better match
      that of phpDocumentor: @license, @link, @version.
    + Removed line tag @licence (use @license instead).

Version 0.7-20070521:
====================
+ Abstract methods cannot be static.
+ define(..., VALUE): "NULL" is now allowed as VALUE.
+ Code that may produce error/exception now generates a Notice rather
  than a Warning message.
+ Warning message on functions beginning with two underscore chars (these
  names are reserved for future extensions of the PHP language).
+ Updated modules: curl (PHP 5.2.1), streams (PHP 5.2.1), standard (PHP 5.2.1),
  mbstring (mb_check_encoding()), simplexml.
+ Keywords INF and NAN moved to the module 'standard' as regular constants.
+ PHP4:
    + Added the /*.abstract.*/ keyword for classes and methods.
    + Abstract methods: the body must be empty, i.e. "{}".
    + The auto-magical detection of static methods was buggy: removed.
      Static methods must be marked explicitly either using the PHPLint
      meta-code /*. static .*/ or the DocBlock @static line tag.
+ PHP5: objects providing the __toString() method are allowed in:
  literal strings; argument of the 'echo' statement; argument of the
  (string) type-cast.
+ New option --[no--]print-line-numbers to suppress line numbers from report.
+ DocBlock parsing mostly reworked:
    + Short/long descr. are now detected accordingly to phpDoc specs.
    + Support for the HTML entities allowed.
    + Now raises an Error on invalid/misspelled line tags, and raises

* `self' and `parent' as type hinting in method arguments now allowed (BUG FIX).
* Added PHPLint meta-code keyword `double' as synonym of `float' (BUG FIX).
* `new self()' and `new parent()' now allowed (BUG FIX).
* `mysqli' extension module: added missing OO-style interface (BUG FIX).

   - added E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR error code (PHP 5.2)
   - added ErrorException class (undocumented by official PHP manual)
* `standard_reflection' module: several corrections (BUG FIX).

Version 0.5-20060806:
====================
* Some changes to the EBNF to comply with the Yacc definition of PHP (see the
  detailed list of the changes below).
* directive() statement: now parse properly raising a warning for values
  different from "ticks", the only one currently defined by PHP.
* Function declaration, default value for formal arg: must be a static
  expression.
* Initial value for "static" variable: must be a static expression.
* switch() statement: every "case" value must be a static expression.
* Class constant: its value must be a static expression, excluding arrays.
* Initial value for class variable: must be a static expression.
* Class constants and class variables: now parse properly list of decls:
  public $a, $b, $c;
* Constants used two or more times but not declared weren't listed in
  the final report -- now they are.
* Minor source cleaning to comply with gcc 4 -Wall. The current version
  of M2 is still not compliant, but it compile apart from some warnings.
* Variable-variables $$x: raises a warning and continue anyway.
* Now "print" is a proper unary operator.
* mysql module, mysql_fetch_field(): now returns an object of a well defined
  (dummy) class so that its fields can be dereferenced.
* standard module, added missing UPLOAD_ERR_* constants.
* standard module, dir() function: now returns an object of a well defined
  "dir" class so that its fields and methods can be dereferenced.

* PHP 4: object returned by method can't be dereferenced. Now raise error.
* PHP 4: new meta-code attributes /*. public|protected|private static final .*/

* PHP 4: methods not using $this were assumed to be 'static'. Feature
  removed after the introduction of the /*. static .*/ meta-code.
* PHP 4: `&' in foreach($a as &$v) isn't allowed. Now raise error.
* PHP 4: default value isn't allowed for arguments passed by reference.
